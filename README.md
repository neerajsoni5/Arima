Time series Forecasting


ARIMA is the most widely used method used for time series forecasting.
I got an opportunity to learn and implemet this method for one of our client......

Those it seems easy but you should aware of the basic assumptions, timeseries objects and how you can use additional variable to enhace accuracy..

Its a type of Market mix model... Attaching one excel with manual calculation for all the three components AR, I ,MA ..
In additions to that basic assumptions, How to tune ? and key concepts are included for reference..

Pardon as the material is random :)
